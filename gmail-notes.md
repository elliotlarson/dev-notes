## Adding email routing for a non-user email address

Sometimes you want to setup an email address that doesn't belong to a user, but routes to multiple people.  For example, engineers@mydomain.com or hello@mydomain.com.

As an admin, login to the admin console and then navigate:

Apps > G Suite > Settings for Gmail > Advanced settings > Default routing > Add setting

1. Add the single recipient: engineers@mydomain.com
1. Prepend custom subject: sent to engineers@mydomain.com
1. Also deliver to:  The email addresses you want to route the email to
