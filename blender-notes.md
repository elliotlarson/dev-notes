# Blender Notes

## Keyboard shortcuts

* `shift + a` = brings up menu to add new things
* `shift + d` = duplicate the selection
* `p` = if you've duplicated part of an object and you now want to make the copied piece its own object, hit `p`
* `n` = bring up the properties sidebar
* `a` = when you are in edit mode and you select a vertex, you can select everything by hitting `a`
* `alt + a` = deselect all
* `g` = when you have a vertex selected you can hit `g` to move it.  To move it an it's neighbor in vertexes, you can turn on proportional editing.
* `alt + left click` = if you want to select a ring or edge, you cal hold down `alt` when you click
* `ctrl + i` = if you have a selection, this will invert it
* `h` = will temporarily hide things that are selected
* `alt + h` = to bring back hidden things
* `tab` = toggle between object and edit modes
* `e` = extrude
* `r` = rotate
* `s` = scale
* `m` = move selected objects to a collection (kind of like a folder)
* `shift + right click` = moves the 3D cursor
* `shift + c` = will put the 3D cursor back to the home position
* `f12` = render
* `ctrl + p` = select the child first and then the parent and then use this keyboard combination to link the objects.  Then when you move the parent object, the child will follow

### Sculpt mode

* `f` = in sculpt mode to change the size of your brush
* `shift + f` = in sculpt mode to change the strength of your brush
* `ctrl` = holding down control while in sculpt mode will change your strokes to subtractive

## Modifiers

You can add a modifier to an object and change it non-destructively

* `solidify` = when you have a plane or shape that is essentially flat, you can apply this modifier to thicken it
* `subdivision` = this gives you more detail having the effect of rounding things out.  It essentially sub divides the face shapes by a certain number.  If you want to keep what it has done, you can click `apply` and this will apply the modifier destructively

## Menu items

* `subdivide` = in the right click menu, if you select this option, the selected object's mech will be doubled, meaning each section will be sub divided by 2. (If you increase the number of cuts to 1, this will average things out and create a smoother subdivision)

* `vertical/horizontal split` = right click on any border around the window and you should see a flyout menu with these options
