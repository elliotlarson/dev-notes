# Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide To Launching a Startup

* [Book's Website](http://www.startupbook.net/)
* [Book At Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968)

## Chapter 1

The book focuses on:

* **"micropreneurs"**: an entrepreneur that wants to remain solo
* **"bootstrappers"**; an entrepreneur who wants a company of up to 10 people

The book assumes you don't want to seek VC funding.  One of the reasons mentioned is that VCs don't care about moderate success.  They want you to focus on big markets and to go for big risk/big wins.  

This book focuses on small, sustainable success for a small group or single person.  To do this **you need to focus on niche markets**.

As a developer, you find development interesting.  Understand that as an entrepreneur, trying to create a successful business, development will be at most 30% of what you will spend your time doing.  The rest is marketing, business development, and support.

### Goals

Figure out what your goals are:

* Financial freedom 
* Growing your business
* Building a portfolio of products, etc.

One short term goal the author recommends is:

> Strive to build a startup that generates $500 a month in profit

This will take a remarkable amount of learning and knowledge to accomplish.

### Roadblocks

The author lists a number of the top roadblocks he's seen:

* There is no market for the product you are developing.  This is the "build it and they will come" phenomenon.  Don't assume that there is a market for your idea and go and build it.  Validate that the market exists first.
* Fear.  It can be scary to start something... I guess.  
* Lack of goals.  Seriously, be clear with yourself about what you are trying to accomplish before setting down the path.
* Inconsistency.  I would call this section **focus** instead.  Be dilligent in following through and put in consistent work that moves you closer to your goal(s).
* Failing to effectively delegate.  Use outsourcing to your advantage.  This will not seem like a time/money saver in the beginning.  Do it anyway, get better at it, and it will pay off when you learn the ropes and become comfortable with your outsourcing personel.  He recommends a personal private assistant VPA (like Tim Ferris does in his 4 Hour Work Week).

He re-iterates the importance of outsourcing:

> Outsourcing aspects of your business is the single most powerful approach I've seen to increasing your true hourly rate as an entrepreneur

### Developer to entrepreneur

The thing you are good at as a developer is not all that important in entrepreneurship.  Finding the right niche market comes first, solid marketing to this market comes next, something aethetically pleasing to this market comes third... then fourth, functionality.  The author says:

> Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetics third, and functionality a distant fourth

> **In the same market, the product with better marketing wins. Everytime.**

You need to fail fast and recover quickly.

Don't expect instant gratification.
