# Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide To Launching a Startup

* [Book's Website](http://www.startupbook.net/)
* [Book At Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968)

The book focuses on:

* **"micropreneurs"**: an entrepreneur that wants to remain solo
* **"bootstrappers"**; an entrepreneur who wants a company of up to 10 people

The book assumes you don't want to seek VC funding.  One of the reasons mentioned is that VCs don't care about moderate success.  They want you to focus on big markets and to go for big risk/big wins.  

This book focuses on small, sustainable success for a small group or single person.  To do this **you need to focus on niche markets**.
