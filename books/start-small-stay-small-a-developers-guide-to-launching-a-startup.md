# Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide To Launching a Startup

* [Book's Website](http://www.startupbook.net/)
* [Book At Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968)

## Chapter 1

The book focuses on:

* **"micropreneurs"**: an entrepreneur that wants to remain solo
* **"bootstrappers"**; an entrepreneur who wants a company of up to 10 people

The book assumes you don't want to seek VC funding.  One of the reasons mentioned is that VCs don't care about moderate success.  They want you to focus on big markets and to go for big risk/big wins.  

This book focuses on small, sustainable success for a small group or single person.  To do this **you need to focus on niche markets**.

As a developer, you find development interesting.  Understand that as an entrepreneur, trying to create a successful business, development will be at most 30% of what you will spend your time doing.  The rest is marketing, business development, and support.

### Goals

Figure out what your goals are:

* Financial freedom 
* Growing your business
* Building a portfolio of products, etc.

One short term goal the author recommends is:

> Strive to build a startup that generates $500 a month in profit

This will take a remarkable amount of learning and knowledge to accomplish.

### Roadblocks

The author lists a number of the top roadblocks he's seen:

* There is no market for the product you are developing.  This is the "build it and they will come" phenomenon.  Don't assume that there is a market for your idea and go and build it.  Validate that the market exists first.
* Fear.  It can be scary to start something... I guess.  
* Lack of goals.  Seriously, be clear with yourself about what you are trying to accomplish before setting down the path.
* Inconsistency.  I would call this section **focus** instead.  Be dilligent in following through and put in consistent work that moves you closer to your goal(s).
* Failing to effectively delegate.  Use outsourcing to your advantage.  This will not seem like a time/money saver in the beginning.  Do it anyway, get better at it, and it will pay off when you learn the ropes and become comfortable with your outsourcing personel.  He recommends a personal private assistant VPA (like Tim Ferris does in his 4 Hour Work Week).

He re-iterates the importance of outsourcing:

> Outsourcing aspects of your business is the single most powerful approach I've seen to increasing your true hourly rate as an entrepreneur

### Developer to entrepreneur

The thing you are good at as a developer is not all that important in entrepreneurship.  Finding the right niche market comes first, solid marketing to this market comes next, something aethetically pleasing to this market comes third... then fourth, functionality.  The author says:

> Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetics third, and functionality a distant fourth

> **In the same market, the product with better marketing wins. Everytime.**

You need to fail fast and recover quickly.

Don't expect instant gratification.

## Chapter 2

If you're looking to hit it big with the startup lottery, that is, create a huge generalist startup company that leads to fame and fortune, your chances of being successful are like 10,000 to 1.  The author is not totally dismissive of this approach, but feels that you're more likely to be succesful setting your sites a bit lower.

### Niches are the name of the game

> Building a general purpose, small-business, online accounting application is a really bad idea for a self-funded startup.

As a small company or one-man team, you don't have the resources to compete with larger companies.  You're better off picking a smaller niche market that larger companies wouldn't want to touch.

Niche's require you to focus your efforts on a smaller group of people.  By specializing, you make it easier to create something custom designed for a group's purposes.  This makes your product more compelling to them than a generalist piece of software.  It also makes it affordable to market to the group.  

**You could probably rename this section of the book: Afordable marketing is the name of the game.**

> The lesson here is that the narrower you can make your product while still maintaining a large enough market, the more profit you will generate. It’s that simple – if you can find a small group of people and make them amazingly happy, you will make money.

> Marketing to large markets is not cost-effective. The larger a market, the more money you’ll need to spend in order to locate people willing to buy your product.

> Advertising to [a] smaller audience is going to garner more "actions per view." If you provide something so uniquely targeted towards them you can focus the ad itself, your copy, and your product on what they need, they are more likely to visit your website.

Niches have less competition.  Larger players aren't interested in small markets.

Niches have higher profit margins.  He uses the example of [Notabene](https://www.notabene.com/), which provides a word proessor for academics.  The software sells for $350, which is substantially more than Microsoft Word.  And, the software is no where near as nice and robust as Word.  But, it solves the problem of putting together bibliographies for academic publications.

Niche markets are not used to good marketing.  You don't have to knock it out of the park with your marketing efforts.

### Finding niches and product ideas

First, look at all areas of your life.

**TODO**: Write down all of your hobies and interests and work/educational experiences.  Look for niches in this list.  These are referred to as **warm** niches because you know something about them personally. To compose a list of luke-warm niches, do this for friends and family.  These are poeple who you could ask directly about the niches they know something about.

You also look for **cold** niches, by spelunking through occupation lists.  You can begin thinking about product ideas for these grouops of people:

* [Wikipedia list of occupations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_occupations)
* [Bureau of Labor Statistics national employment data](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.t01.htm): There's also some information here about how much the average person makes in the lines of work

There are also existing lists of business ideas:

* [Entrepreneur.com business idea center](https://www.entrepreneur.com/businessideas)
* [Ycombinator Requests for startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)
* [Ahhbo list of home businesses](http://www.ahbbo.com/ideas.html)
* [A Startup a Day](https://astartupaday.wordpress.com/) blog of business ideas

* [Cool Business Ideas](http://www.coolbusinessideas.com/) 

### Evaluating a niche

**TODO**: Find magazines, meetup groups, and online forums where people in this niche hangout.  Get advertising rate cards for these publications.  Most of them will have it on their website.  This will allow you to asses the cost of marketing to this group.

> When searching for a niche, there’s a loose rule of thumb that says to stick to markets where you can take out a full-page ad in a magazine targeted at your market for less than $5,000.


> As an aside, I don’t recommend magazine advertising due to the difficulty of tracking prospects, the inability to tweak content mid-stream, and the challenge of getting people to “switch media” from print to the web. But understanding how magazine publishers segment the market will provide you with insight into viable niches.


> ... if you’re targeting a niche that has a magazine devoted to them, such as bass fishermen or ASP.NET programmers, you’re on the right track.


> Beyond searching for a magazine that caters to your market, you should also look at census and labor statistics to get an estimate of your market size. It’s important to remember during this process that a large market is not helpful if you can’t reach them economically through a specific website or magazine.


> Be wary of a market if you are unable to find a handful of websites or a magazine/journal dedicated to it, and the labor statistics claim less than 10,000 members.
