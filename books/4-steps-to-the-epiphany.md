# 4 Steps to the Epiphany

## Product Development Model

The old-school approach that didn't work.  (think Webvan)  Overly focused on developing product and first ship date without thorough understanding of customers.

1. concept/seed
1. product development
1. alpha/beta test
1. launch ship (1st ship)

This is a waterfall development approach.

### problems with this model

1. This is focused more on product than customers

    > "The greatest risk—and hence the greatest cause of failure—in startups is not in the development of the new product but in the development of customers and markets."

1. Focus on the first customer ship date

    > "The first customer ship date does not mean the company understands its customers or how to market or sell to them."

1. There's an emphasis on execution over learning and discovery

1. Lack of sales, marketing and business development milestones

1. Premature scaling

## Startups fall into one of four basic categories:

* Bringing a new product into an existing market
* Bringing a new product into a new market
* Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant
* Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant

## The technology lifecycle curve

Developed by Everette Rogers and enhaced with the notion of the chasm by Geoff Moore:

On a bell curve adoption works like:

1. Inovators / Techies
1. Early Adopters
1. Early majority (main stream)
1. Late majority (main stream)
1. Laggards

The idea is that there are chasms between each of the groups with the largest chasm between early adopters and the the early mainstream.  The chasms are caused by different product needs and buying habits of each group.

**This is not a good roadmap for an early stage startup**: most of the customer and market validation is achieved during the initial stages of the curve and this should be your main focus.  Do not think of enthusiasts as just a small segment in the beginning.  They are your focus.

## Customer development

Separate and distinct from the product development process, customer development happens in parallel and instructs product development.  It involves finding out who your users are and what markets they are in.  Before any sales and marketing can happen, a company must prove that a market exists and verify that people are willing to pay for a product.  You can not create a market or customer demand where there isn't any customer interest.

Separates out the customer related activities in the early stage of a company into their own processes:

* Customer Discovery
* Customer Validation
* Customer Creation
* Company Building

**Note**: Customer development does not replace product development, it is a companion to it.

Customer discover is focuses on testing whether a company's business model is correct by focusing on whether or not the model solves actual customer problems and needs.

"It's okay to screw up if you plan to learn from it."

An interesting consequence of this model is that it keeps a startup's burn rate low until it has validated its business model with paying customers.

When you get out of the building and talk to customers, you are not looking to assemble a feature list.  You are attempting to understand what problems your customers are trying to solve.  You are looking to gain unique insight.

You are trying to find out if there are customers for your company's vision.

## Customer validation

The goal of this step is to build a repeatable sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams that will follow later.

Customer validation proves that you have found a set of customers and a market that reacts positively to your product.

It is business model corroboration

## Customer creation

Builds on the success of the initial company sales.  Goal is to create end user demand and drive that demand into the company's sales pipeline.

**Note**: Brand building and heavy advertising make a lot of sense when entering an existing market where customers already understand your product and service.  However this approach in a new market would be like throwing money down the drain.  Customers don't even now what problem you really solve for them yet.

## Company building

Transitioning from learning based into a structured organization that executes.

## Four types of startup markets

* Entering an existing market
* Creating an entirely new market
* Re-segment an existing market as a low cost entrant
* Re-segment an existing market as a niche provider

The strategies and tactics used for these different types of companies are different.
