# The Lean Startup Notes

## Quotes

"The grim reality is that most startups fail." p.2

"Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers.  They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business." p.8-9

"The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere." p.9

"The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible." p.20

"A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty." p.27

"... if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its most vital function is learning." p.38

"...customers could not tell us what they wanted... instead, they revealed the truth through their action or inaction..." p.43

"Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste." p.48

"...learning is the essential unit of progress for startups." p.49

"...true startup productivity [is] systematically figuring out the right things to build." p.52

"The goal of early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers.  Instead, it is to clarify at a basic, course level that we understand our potential customer and what problems they have.

"... because customers don't really know what they want, it's easy for... entrepreneurs to delude themselves that they are on the right path [after talking to customers]." p.90

"The goal [of the minimum viable product] is to test fundamental business hypotheses." p.94

"Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time." p.96

"Customers don't care how much time something takes to build.  They only care if it serves their needs." p.109

"... cohort based reports are the gold standard of learning metrics..." p.144

"... the more money, time, and creative energy that has been sunk into an idea, the harder it is to pivot." p.153

"... the runway that [a] startup has left [is]: the amount of remaining time in which a startup must either achieve lift-off or fail.  This is usually defined as the remaining cash in the bank divided by the monthly burn rate..." p.160

## Notes

#### The 5 principles of the lean startup

1. entrepreneurs are everywhere
2. entrepreneurship is management 
3. validated learning
4. build-measure-learn
5. innovation accounting

#### The two most important assumptions

1. **value hypothesis**: tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers
2. **growth hypothesis**: tests how new customers will discover a product or service

#### Four important questions

1. Do customers recognize they have the problem you are trying to solve?
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
4. Can we build a solution for that problem?

It's common for engineers to jump to #4.
