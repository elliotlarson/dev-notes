# The Lean Startup Notes

## Quotes

"The grim reality is that most startups fail." p.2

"Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers.  They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business." p.8-9

"The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere." p.9

"The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible." p.20

"A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty." p.27

"... if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its most vital function is learning." p.38

"...customers could not tell us what they wanted... instead, they revealed the truth through their action or inaction..." p.43

"Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste." p.48

"...learning is the essential unit of progress for startups." p.49

"...true startup productivity [is] systematically figuring out the right things to build." p.52

"The goal of early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers.  Instead, it is to clarify at a basic, course level that we understand our potential customer and what problems they have.  With that understanding, we can craft a customer archetype, a brief document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer." p.89

"... because customers don't really know what they want, it's easy for... entrepreneurs to delude themselves that they are on the right path [after talking to customers]." p.90

"The goal [of the minimum viable product] is to test fundamental business hypotheses." p.94

"Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time." p.96

"Customers don't care how much time something takes to build.  They only care if it serves their needs." p.109

"... cohort based reports are the gold standard of learning metrics..." p.144

"... the more money, time, and creative energy that has been sunk into an idea, the harder it is to pivot." p.153

"... the runway that [a] startup has left [is]: the amount of remaining time in which a startup must either achieve lift-off or fail.  This is usually defined as the remaining cash in the bank divided by the monthly burn rate..." p.160

"... our efforts at tuning the engine were reaching diminishing returns, the classic sign of the need to pivot." p.171

"A pivot... is a special kind of structured change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.  It is the heart of the Lean Startrup method." p.178

"The critical first question for any lean transformation is: which activities create value and which are a form of waste?" p.181

"There are always a zillion new ideas about how to make the product better floating around, but the hard truth is that most of those ideas make a difference only at the margins.  They are mere optimizations.  Startups have to focus on the big experiments that lead to validated learning.  The engines of growth framework helps them stay focused on the metrics that matter." p.209

"The ability to grow in the long term using the paid engine requires a differentiated ability to monetize a certain set of customers." p.218

"... the individual efficiency of these [people] is not the goal in a lean startup.  Instead, we want to force teams to work cross-functionally to achieve validated learning." p.271

"It does not matter how fast we can build.  It does not matter how fast we can measure.  What matters is how fast we can get through the entire loop." p.271


## Notes

#### The 5 principles of the lean startup

1. entrepreneurs are everywhere
2. entrepreneurship is management 
3. validated learning
4. build-measure-learn
5. innovation accounting

#### The two most important assumptions

1. **value hypothesis**: tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers
2. **growth hypothesis**: tests how new customers will discover a product or service

#### Four important questions

1. Do customers recognize they have the problem you are trying to solve?
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
4. Can we build a solution for that problem?

It's common for engineers to jump to #4.

#### The two most important assumptions:

These give rise to tuning variables that drive the startup's engine of growth

1. value hypothesis
2. growth hypothesis

#### Misc Notes:

* user stories are not complete until they lead to validated learning

#### Catalog of Pivots (p.173)

* **zoom-in pivot** - a single feature of a product becomes the whole product
* **zoom-out pivot** - the product is too limited and expands its feature set 
* **customer segment pivot** - the product is directed at a different customer base
* **customer need pivot** - focusing on different customer need(s)
* **platform pivot** - changing from an app to a platform for apps, or vice versa
* **business architecture pivot** - changing from high margin, low volume to low margin, high volume (or vice versa)
* **value capture pivot** - changing the way the company captures customer value (monetization strategy)
* **engine of growth pivot** - change in growth strategy (viral, sticky, paid)
* **channel pivot** - a change in the sales or distribution channel 
* **technology pivot** - changing approach to using the technology

#### Where sustainable growth comes from

New customers come from the actions of past customers.

There are four ways past customers drive sustainable growth:

* word of mouth
* as a side effect of product usage
* through funded advertising 
* through repeat purchase or use

#### Engines of growth

* **Sticky**: getting and holding onto customers for the long term. high customer retention rate is necessary.  The rules that govern sticky growth are simple: if the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow.  The churn rate is defined as the fraction o f customers in any period who fail to remain engaged with the company's product.  read more about this on p.211

* **viral engine of growth** - awareness of the product spreads rapidly from customer to customer.  This is not word of mouth, rather it is result of customers using the product and other people finding out about the product from their use.  Growth is determined by looking at the viral coefficient.  This measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence  of each new customer who signs up. (how many friends will each customer bring?)  Most viral customers don't charge customers directly but rely on indirect sources of revenue.

* **paid engine of growth** - each customer pays a certain amount for a product over his or her "lifetime" as a customer, called the customer lifetime value (LTV).  Each new customer has a cost per acquisition (CPA).  The margin between the CPA and the LTV determines how fast the paid engine of growth goes.

#### Adopt these rules:

* be tolerant of all mistakes the first time
* never let the same mistake happen twice
