# Python Jupyter Notes

This is a tool used to explain data with a combination of input output sections, markdown sections, and visualizations/graphs.

## Install

It's recommended that you run Jupyter with Anaconda.  But, if you don't want to run Anaconda, you can just install it directly with pip.

```bash
$ python -m install jupyter
```

## Running

Jupyter is a server that you can run locally.

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will launch a server on port 8888.  When you create files in your notebook, the resulting file is saved in the directory you're running the server in as a `.ipynb` file.
